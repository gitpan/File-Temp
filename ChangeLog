	--- RELEASE 0.17 CPAN ----
	
	* Temp.pm: Also inherit from IO::Seekable so that seek and tell
	methods can work on filehandles (thanks to Rick Myers and Toby Corkindale).

	* t/seekable.t: Add test script from Rick Myers.
	
	* Temp.pm: Add note about forking and resetting the random number generator
	to prevent multiple clashes of temp file names. (pointed out by Brent Cowgill)

	* Temp.pm: pre-emptively load Carp::Heavy. If we don't when we run out of file
	handles and attempt to call croak() we get an error message telling
	us that Carp::Heavy won't load rather than an error telling us we
	have run out of file handles. (pointed out by bjoern_at_hoehrmann.de RT #14151)

	* Temp.pm: Remove eg. from comments and replace with e.g. In pod
	replace "e.g." with "for example". (David Landgren)

	* Temp.pm: Correct synopsis concerning the arguments to the
	File::Temp constructor (Peter Valdemar Moerch).

	* Temp.pm: Update documentation to note that croak() will be
	called by tempfile() and File::Temp->new if a problem occurs (thanks to Steve
	Hay for pointing this out).

2005-09-01  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* Temp.pm: Sebastien Aperghis-Tramoni indicates that File::Temp
	works with perl 5.004 so change the minimum perl version. (RT #14149)

	* Temp.pm: Use effective uid rather than real uid (Alexey Tourbin RT #14218)

2005-02-22  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	--- RELEASE V0.16 ---
	
	* Temp.pm: Remove spurious debug statement

2005-02-21  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	--- RELEASE V0.15 ---
	
	* Temp.pm (unlink_on_destroy): Add post-object creation method to
	control whether the temp file will be unlinked when the object
	goes out of scope.
	
	* Temp.pm: Increase maximum number of tries before aborting.

	* Temp.pm: Add $KEEP_ALL to allow the temporary files to be
	retained whilst debugging (suggestion from Ed Avis [and others]).

	* Temp.pm: Temp files should have been opened O_NOFOLLOW rather
	than O_FOLLOW! (thanks to Marc Tardif)

	* Temp.pm: Add cleanup() function so that temp files that would be
	removed by an END block can be removed by a daemon. (RT wishlist
	item #6928 by Robert Rothenberg)

	* Temp.pm: Force chmod on file before unlinking it. This can be a
	problem on windows (see RT bug #6935). tempdir() has been fixed by
	Slaven's earlier patch to change the rmtree arguments.

	* Temp.pm (top_system_uid): Add interix patch from Todd Vierling

	* Temp.pm (_gettemp): Pod patch from Steven Lembark clarifying the
	error message associated with two few XXXXs

	* Temp.pm: Add note on forking and make sure that END blocks only
	remove temporary files created by the current process ID (prompted
	by Daniel Macks in RT bug #11067)

	* Temp.pm (cmpstat): Roman Vasicek reported problems with the _
	filehandle. Play it safe and remove that handle. (see RT bug #8822)

	* t/tempfile.t: Add test for write proteceted temp file (thanks to
	Slaven Rezic)

	* Temp.pm (_can_do_level): Change argument to rmtree to make it
	attempt to remove write-protected files on cleanup (thanks to
	Slaven Rezic)

	* Temp.pm: Add note on binmode usage
	
2003-08-16  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* Temp.pm: mpeix fixes from Ken Hirsch <hirschk@labcorp.com>

2003-08-15  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>
	
	--- RELEASE V0.13 ---
	
	* Temp.pm: Integrate doc fixes from bleadperl (Slaven Rezic and
	Jeffrey Friedl)

	* Makefile.PL: Add INSTALLDIRS switch on perl version so that the
	module installs into the correct place for perl 5.6.1 and newer.

2002-08-28  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* Temp.pm: Synch with perl 5.8.0 v0.13 MacOS fixes (Chris Nandor)

	croaking.

2001-02-21  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* Temp.pm: 
	      -Add fix for CGI::Carp 
                  [Thanks to John Labovitz <johnl@valiha.inside.sealabs.com>]
              - Use error string to propogate reason rather than a carp

2000-11-24  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

        --- RELEASE V0.11 ----

	* t/tempfile.t: Add a test to make sure the file is present after
	close and another to use tempfile in a scalar context.

	* Temp.pm: Fix bug on NT with O_TEMPORARY causing the file to be
	removed before the program exits. 

        ---- RELEASE V0.10 ----
	
	* Temp.pm: Incorporate fixes up to bleedperl 7825. Cross platform
	fixes.

	* t/security.t: Incorporate fixes from bleedperl 7825 - adds more
	cross platform support and more skips on the basis that this is
	not testing your system security, just the module.

2000-08-16  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* Temp.pm (_gettemp): Dont use VMS::Stdio if we want the file
	to remain after closing.

2000-08-15  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* Temp.pm (_can_do_level): cygwin patch

	* Temp.pm: Add Support for VMS and OS/2 

2000-05-15  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

        * Release V0.08 to CPAN
	
	* t/mktemp.t: Skip the test for unlink0 if it fails since in most
	cases this indicates an NFS problem.

	* Temp.pm (_can_do_level): Add check to make sure an OS can handle 
	the required safe level
	(safe_level): Check the level can be supported before allowing it
	to change 
	(END): Change order of cleanup so that files are removed ahead of
	temp dirs (since files may be in the temp dirs) 

2000-05-08  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* Temp.pm: Reorganize END block 

	* t/tempfile.t: Correct tests for new position of END{} block

	improves speed of the commands by nearly a factor of 3.
	(_replace_XX): Inline the character replacement code rather than
	using _randchar subroutine. Improves performance by an additional 8%.

2000-04-27  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* t/posix.t: Add explicit autoflush on filehandle

	* t/mktemp.t: Add explicit autoflush on filehandle

	perl 5.005 or earlier.

	handles). VERSION NUMBER NOW 0.07

	* README: Update in preparation for V0.06 

	* Temp.pm (_deferred_unlink): Add new internal routine to centralise the
	configuring of END blocks. This also fixes a bug where only the
	first file was being unlinked in the END block (due to scoping).

	(_can_unlink_opened_file): Rename from _can_unlink. Will now
	return false if running on Windows.

	(_is_verysafe): If _PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED is not available assume
	that "chown giveaway" is possible anyway.

	(unlink0): If can not unlink an open file, simply defer removal
	until later.

	they are available (Thanks to Tom Christiansen for this)
