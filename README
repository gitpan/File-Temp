File::Temp - provides functions for generating temporary files

This is the first public release of File::Temp. This module can be used to
generate temporary files (providing a filename and filehandle) or directories.
Possible race conditions are avoided and some security checks are performed
(eg making sure the sticky bit is set on world writeable temp directories).

It could be considered to be in a late alpha state since it has only been
tested on two operating systems.

Please let me know if it fails on other operating systems.

INSTALLATION

 % perl Makefile.PL
 % make
 % make test
 % make install

Currently the tests are not very good (a single test.pl) but do test every
command. A more thorough test of all functions will be provided for the next
release.

REQUIREMENTS

Requires perl 5.6

Written completely in Perl. XS is not required.

File::Spec greater than 0.7 is required.
Fcntl from perl5.5.670 or higher.
This is standard on Perl 5.6

PLATFORMS

Tested with perl5.5.670 on RedHat Linux 6.1, Solaris 2.6 and Windows NT 4.

Still needs work on non-Unix platforms to adjust test severity (for example
syickyness test does not work on NT, and neither does unlink on an open
file (I believe).
